    <h2 class="title2">Description</h2>
        <p class="description-body">An omelette is a dish made from eggs, fried with butter or oil in a frying pan.</p>
    <h2 class="title2">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="unordered">
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Cold Water</li>
            <li>Cayenne and white pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h2 class="title2">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="ordered">
            <li>Whisk eggs, water, and salt together in a mixing bowl. Whisk until mixture is very liquid and whites are completliy blended in, 1 or 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in a 9- or 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. As soon as butter mlits and before it starts to sizzle, pour in whisked eggs. Stir in a circular pattern with a heat-proof spatula, lifting and scrambling eggs, shaking the pan to keep levliing out the mixture, and scraping down the sides. Continue stirring until shaking the pan no longer levlis the eggs.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to low. Using the spatula, smooth the surface to move runny eggs to less runny spots, working toward an even thickness. As soon as the surface is wet but not runny, remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Starting at the handle side of the pan, use the spatula to begin rolling omelette into a cylinder shape, about 3 rolls until omelette is about 2 inches from opposite side of the pan. Use the spatula to fold the last flap of egg over the top of the cylinder leaving the seam-side up. Add remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter to the pan. Gently push the butter as it mlits under the omelette.</li>
            <li>Slide omelette to edge of the pan. Flip onto a plate with the seam-side down. Even out the shape, if necessary. You can tuck in the ends, if you like. Brush surface with a bit more butter. Dust with cayenne pepper.</li>
        </ol>
